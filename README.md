# Smart Integer Calculator 🧮

This is a Python-based calculator that doesn’t just compute results — it **explains** them. Built to reinforce math fundamentals (especially integer operations) while developing clean, logical Python code that reflects how systems and cryptographic engines process numbers.

## 🔍 Features

- Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers
- Provides explanations for each result, including sign logic and absolute value reasoning
- Clean, readable logic — now being refactored into modular functions
- Great for beginners learning Python or cryptographic math thinking

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Written and tested inside WSL + VS Code
- Linter-enabled and structured for future expansion

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of a larger goal to:
- Build deep fluency in integer math
- Develop system-level thinking for cryptography
- Practice writing explainable, readable code — not just working code

## 🚧 Refactor Status

Refactoring underway:
- ✅ Addition logic function in progress
- 🔜 Subtraction, multiplication, division logic separation
- 🔜 Modular arithmetic and CLI extension

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- How Python handles signed integer operations
- Importance of structure, indentation, and abstraction
- How to debug and improve nested logic and branching
